# Welcome to Physical AI

## The Next Frontier of Intelligence

Welcome to the exciting world of **Physical AI**. You are about to embark on a journey that bridges the gap between the digital world of code and the physical world of atoms.

### What is Physical AI?

For decades, Artificial Intelligence has lived mostly on screens—generating text, recognizing images, or playing games. **Physical AI** is different. It is AI that *acts* upon the world. It is the brain inside a robot, the intelligence behind a self-driving car, and the logic controlling a smart factory.

> [!NOTE]
> **Embodied Intelligence**: Physical AI is often called "Embodied AI" because the intelligence is not just in the cloud; it is embodied in a physical form that must obey the laws of physics.

### Why Now?

Three major trends are converging to make this the golden age of Physical AI:

1.  **Better Brains**: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models give robots "common sense" reasoning capabilities they never had before.
2.  **Better Bodies**: Hardware is becoming cheaper, more reliable, and more accessible (like the NVIDIA Jetson Orin we will use in this book).
3.  **Better Tools**: Frameworks like ROS 2 and Isaac Sim have lowered the barrier to entry significantly.

### What You Will Learn

In this book, we will take you from **Zero to Hero**:

*   **Beginner**: We'll start with the basics of setting up your environment and understanding the core concepts of robotics.
*   **Intermediate**: You'll learn ROS 2, the industry-standard operating system for robots, and how to simulate robots in virtual worlds.
*   **Advanced**: We'll deploy cutting-edge AI models (like RAG and VLAs) onto actual hardware and build a complete robotic system.

Let's get started!
